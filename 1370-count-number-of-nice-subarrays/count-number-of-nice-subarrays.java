/*
Approach:
Instead of counting subarrays with exactly k odd numbers directly,
I first count the number of subarrays having at most k odd numbers 
and then count the number of subarrays having at most (k-1) odd numbers.
The difference between these two counts gives the number of subarrays with exactly k odd
numbers. I use a sliding window where I expand the right pointer
and keep track of the number of odd elements in the current window.
If the number of odd elements becomes greater than k, I shrink the window
from the left until it becomes valid again. For every valid window, all subarrays ending at
the current index are valid, so I add (right - left + 1) to the answer.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
