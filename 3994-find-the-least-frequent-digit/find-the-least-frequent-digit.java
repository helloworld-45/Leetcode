/*
Approach:
Create a frequency array of size 10 to store the count of each digit. Traverse the number by extracting one digit at a time using the modulo operator and increment its frequency. Once all digits are counted, iterate through the frequency array from 0 to 9 and keep track of the digit with the smallest non-zero frequency. Since the traversal is in increasing order, if multiple digits have the same minimum frequency, the smallest digit is returned automatically.
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
